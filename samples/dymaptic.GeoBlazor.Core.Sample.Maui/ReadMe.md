# Blazor MAUI Hybrid Sample

This sample shows how to use the GeoBlazor library in a Blazor MAUI Hybrid App. It also showcases many different features of the library.

To run the samples, you need to create the file `appsettings.json` in this directory, then add an ArcGIS API key and a 
GeoBlazor Registration key to the file.

```json
{
  "ArcGisAPIKey": "YOUR_ARCGIS_API_KEY",
  "GeoBlazor" : {
    "LicenseKey": "YOUR_GEOBLAZOR_LICENSE_KEY"
  }
}
```

See https://docs.geoblazor.com/pages/authentication.html for more information on how to get your keys.
