    ///     Polyline geometries can have self-intersecting paths, however they cannot have degenerate segments. A degenerate segment is a zero-length segment where the start and end points are essentially the same. When the polyline has no z, degenerate segments are those that have a length in the xy plane less than or equal to the tolerance. When the polyline has z, degenerate segments are those that are shorter than the tolerance in the xy plane, and the change in the z-value along the segment is less than or equal to the z-tolerance.
