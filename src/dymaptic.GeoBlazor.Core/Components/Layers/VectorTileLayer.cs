///     VectorTileLayer accesses cached tiles of data and renders it in vector format. It is similar to a WebTileLayer in
///     the context of caching; however, a WebTileLayer renders as a series of images, not vector data. Unlike raster
///     tiles, vector tiles can adapt to the resolution of their display device and can be restyled for multiple uses.
///     VectorTileLayer delivers styled maps while taking advantage of cached raster map tiles with vector map data.
