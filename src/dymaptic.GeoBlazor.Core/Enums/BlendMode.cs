///     Blend modes are used to blend layers together to create an interesting effect in a layer, or even to produce what
///     seems like a new layer. Unlike the method of using transparency which can result in a washed-out top layer, blend
///     modes can create a variety of very vibrant and intriguing results by blending a layer with the layer(s) below it.
